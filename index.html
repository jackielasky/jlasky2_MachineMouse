<h2>Machine Mouse</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
The purpose or high concept of the game is to complete a series of 10 challenges that serve as obstacles in your path to reach the email icon. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the players to experience excitement, anxiousness, and curiosity as they go through the challenges and try to reach the finish line.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
The genre of the game is rests between puzzle-solving, code breaking, and adventure.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
For game play, the main character, Mr. Mouse, will have several appropriate actions. Depending on the present challenge he is concerned with, he will be able to use spacebar to 
throw cheese at enemies and use the arrow keys to navigate left and right. There will be 10 challenges to complete, all using familiar windows features including: 
turning on the wifi, increasing the brightness, disabling the firewall, etc. which are all going to have unique challenges that Mr. Mouse will have to conquer. 
Some challenges will require user input from the keyboard, if it is one of the code breaking challenges. These puzzles are still under development, but will each require the player to exploit the vulnerability in the system.
There is a moderate element of exploration in the game. As the character interacts with an object, he can sometimes enter directories.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The game mechanic that the prototype is evaluating are the rules and challenges faced by the character involving code-breaking and puzzle-solving.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The major features that set apart this game from others is that its world is macrocosm in that it is taking the smaller view that we have when we look at a computer desktop screen, and magnifying it and putting the character directly in the world and 
interacting physically with these objects that are usually only interacted with from afar. 
The game will be top down and scrollable, so the character has a variety of space to move around and explore the game world and complete tasks. 
What makes the game world unique, besides being a macrocosm of the digital world, is that it allows the player to interact with interesting objects. 
The behaviors of these objects will each present a new challenge for Mr. Mouse (the main character). 
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The setting is a Windows computer desktop and the occupants are all related to familiar Windows components. The goals and challenges are all related to things seen on Windows computers like the email icon, brightness feature, etc.</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
There is a storyline to add to the flow of the game. You are Mr. Mouse and have been caught stealing important files from a computer to advance your company. Your job is to find your way to the email icon, so you can send the competing company’s files to your own computer from the enemy’s local machine.
The owner of the computer knows your there, so he has decided to make it as hard for you as possible to escape with his files. He has done a variety of things to the computer to lock it down, and your job is to exploit these vulnerabilities and then send the files to your own email by reaching his email icon. 
If you can complete all of the 10 challenges, you should be able to get to the email icon, and send the enemy’s files.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The target audience and demographic sought are teenagers and older that are interested in solving puzzles and that like computers. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The play time takes about 5-10 minutes.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The most applicable strategies will be puzzle-solving, patience, and focus.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I found sources on google for my assets.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
There are no other games that I drew examples from.
